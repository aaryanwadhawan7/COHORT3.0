// Middlewares and cors 

// Middleware -> change the req. or res. object, 
//               end the req-res cycle or 
//               calling the next middleware fn in the stack.
// [ 1. It may or may not change the request object.
//   2. It will either stop the req. object or forward it to the real route handler.]
